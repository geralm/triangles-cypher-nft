# 🔺 Triangles-Cypher-NFT

This repository contains a deployable smart contract designed to mint a non-transferable NFT that registers and verifies the authorship of the **Advecedary Encoder** — a symbolic alphabet system that encodes letters into triangular shapes.

By deploying this contract, the original creator ensures **on-chain authorship**, providing **immutable proof of origin** and anchoring the project’s intellectual property under a **non-commercial MIT License**.

---

## 📜 Purpose

- ✅ Register the **creator** of the triangular-based symbolic encoding system.
- ✅ Allow anyone to **interact**, **fork**, or **experiment** with the project.
- ❌ Commercial use is **strictly prohibited**.
- 🧠 Promote **educational**, **personal**, and **artistic** usage.

This NFT acts as a **public certificate of authorship** for the encoded alphabet and its creative methodology.
