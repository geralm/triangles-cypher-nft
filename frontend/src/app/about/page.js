        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          When I was in my 20s, I was searching for inspiration from Nordic or secret alphabets as a gift. The idea came to me to make a present for a girl. I won&apos;t lieâ€”I was deeply in love with her.

          From Inspiration to Code
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          While browsing the internet, I came across something similar. I made some modifications and coded a program in Java to translate the text. (Programmers want things easy and interesting at the same time.)

          A Secret Message of Love
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          I wrote her a love letter (the things love makes us do) with the text encoded and included its alphabet. It turned out that the text was quite difficult for her (and for most people), so no one could decipher it.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          I started making some modifications in Python until I came up with the idea to start this project. Maybe the community can do something interesting with it.
